# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 3-arrays.rb
foods = ["tacos", "pizza", "ice cream"]
# puts foods.inspect
# p foods

# Arrays are lists of things
numbers = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
# p numbers

mixed_stuff = ["tacos", 3, true]
# p mixed_stuff

# Accessing the array
# puts foods[0]
# puts nil
# puts ""

# Add to the array
# shopping_list = foods + ["eggs"]
# p shopping_list

my_list = ["toys", "pullups"]
foods.push(my_list)
p foods
p foods [3][1]


# There are lots of fun things you can do with arrays:
